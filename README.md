# Rename + Compress Agent (MVP v0.1)

This repository contains a small CLI tool that batch-compresses and renames JPG/JPEG images.

See the `rename-agent/README.md` for full usage and details (Chinese localized README is inside the `rename-agent` folder).

Quick start:

```bash
cd rename-agent
npm install
npm start -- <slug>
```

Notes:
- Original images and outputs are excluded from git via `.gitignore` (`compress/`, `done-compress/`).
- The project is MIT licensed.
